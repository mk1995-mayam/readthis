        <h1>Snehal, I Have a Question for You... üíç</h1>
        <p>
            When we started talking on November 29, neither of us knew where this journey would lead. We are different in so many ways, and at first, I wasn‚Äôt sure if we were meant to be. But as time passed, I saw something deeper‚Äîsomething real.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite our differences, we share the same core values‚Äîfamily, life, and what truly matters. Somewhere along the way, I found myself looking forward to our moments together.
        </p>
        <h2>Will you marry me, not because it was arranged, but because I truly want to spend my life with you? üíç‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
